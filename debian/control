Description: A transparent proxy
 any_proxy is a program that transparently proxies any tcp connection to an upstream proxy
 without requiring end users to configure a proxy server on their host.
 You need to have an upstream proxy, such as squid, that allows CONNECT.
 See http://github.com/ryanchapman/go-any-proxy for more information.
