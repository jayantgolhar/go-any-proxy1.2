Template: any-proxy/listenport
Type: string
Default: 3128
Description: Listen on port:
  Enter the port where any_proxy should listen for 
  requests. Default is 3128.

Template: any-proxy/portstoproxy
Type: string
Default: 0:65535
Description: Ports to proxy:
  Enter the ports which should be proxied through any_proxy.

  With the default (0:65535), when a user attempts to make a
  connection to a host on port 0 through 65535, iptables will
  redirect the request to any_proxy.
  
  The syntax of this option is the same as iptables --dport
  option, which is port[,port][,begin:end]

Template: any-proxy/proxyservers
Type: string
Description: Upstream proxy servers:
  Enter your upstream proxy servers IP addresses and ports.

  For example, 192.168.10.1:80,192.168.20.1:8080
  would configure any_proxy to send traffic to the 
  proxy server at 192.168.10.1 listening on port 80 
  and the proxy server at 192.168.20.1 listening on port 8080.

Template: any-proxy/directservers
Type: string
Description: Direct servers:
  Enter the IP addresses of any destination hosts
  that should not be sent to an upstream proxy.  Instead,
  traffic will be sent directly to the servers you specify
  in this list.

  For example, 192.168.10.1,192.168.20.1
  would configure any_proxy so that when a host requests
  to make a connection to 192.168.10.1 or 192.168.20.1,
  the traffic will not be sent to the upstream proxies.
